# üß† LinPack ‚Äì A Way to Manage Vulnerable Linux Packages More Efficiently

LinPack is a semantic-based system designed to identify and monitor vulnerabilities in Linux environments. It analyzes actions recorded by the Debian package manager (`dpkg.log`) and cross-references them with public vulnerability databases, such as the NVD. The result is a **knowledge graph** that enables intelligent, visual exploration of a system‚Äôs security posture.s

## ‚ùì Why LinPack?

The **Directive (EU) 2022/2555 (NIS 2)** requires all Member States to ensure a high level of cybersecurity by promoting the adoption of technologies capable of detecting and preventing cyber threats early and efficiently. It encourages the development of **automated or semi-automated solutions** for identifying vulnerabilities and minimizing exposure.

Despite this directive, **most current vulnerability detection strategies still rely on manual analysis or static tools**, which limits their efficiency and prolongs system exposure to threats. This creates a clear need for smarter, more adaptive solutions.

To address this gap, we developed **LinPack** ‚Äî a semantic-based system for identifying and monitoring vulnerabilities in Linux environments.

LinPack collects data about installed packages and known security vulnerabilities, and then organizes it into a **knowledge graph**. This allows for:

- **Intuitive and visual exploration** of a system's security posture;
- **Faster identification of at-risk packages**;
- **Improved monitoring** of evolving vulnerabilities.

## System stores this structured information in a triple store, a type of **non-relational database**, enabling advanced semantic queries and flexible data management.

# üöÄ Getting Started

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

- Python
- Docker (to run Virtuoso)
- SPARQLWrapper

---

## üì¶ 1. Setting up Virtuoso

```bash
docker pull openlink/virtuoso-opensource-7
docker run -d -p 8890:8890 --name virtuoso openlink/virtuoso-opensource-7
docker exec -it virtuoso bash
```

After running the container, access Virtuoso at `http://localhost:8890` with default credentials (`dba`/`dba`).

- Go to the **"Linked Data"** tab ‚Üí **"Quad Store Upload"**  
  ‚Üí Upload `linpack_ontology.ttl` and name it: `http://localhost:8890/linpack`

- Set up SPARQL user permissions:

  - Go to **"System Admin"** ‚Üí **"User Accounts"**
  - Edit user `SPARQL` and check **all "Read" and "Write"** permissions
  - Save changes

- Set default RDF permissions:
  - Go to **"Database"** ‚Üí **"Interactive SQL"**
  - Execute the following SQL command:

```sql
DB.DBA.RDF_DEFAULT_USER_PERMS_SET ('nobody', 7);
```

---

## üì• 2. Cloning the Repository and Setting Up the Environment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FebioSilva/LinPack-Security-Manager.git
cd LinPack-Security-Manager/code
pip install SPARQLWrapper
cd app
npm install
```

---

## üêç 3. Running the Python Scripts to Populate Virtuoso DB

```bash
cd ../log
python log.py
cd ../nvd
python nvd.py
```

### ‚úÖ Testing the Setup

To verify that everything is working, run this example query in Virtuoso's SPARQL UI:

- Go to **"Linked Data"** ‚Üí **"SPARQL"**
- Paste the following queries and execute it:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://purl.org/cyber/cve#>
SELECT ?cve ?description ?score
WHERE {
  ?cve a :CVE ;
       :description ?description ;
       :base_score ?score .
}
LIMIT 10

```

```sparql
SELECT ?event ?action ?timestamp ?package
WHERE {
  ?event a :ActionEvent ;
         :action ?action ;
         :timestamp ?timestamp ;
         :has_package ?package .
}
LIMIT 10
```

If successful, this will return a list of CVEs for the first query and a list of packages for the second query, confirming that the data has been correctly uploaded to Virtuoso.

---

## üåê 4. Running the Web Interface (basic prototype)

```bash
cd ../app/js
node proxy.js
```

Now open `index.html` in your browser to access LinPack's web interface. The app connects to Virtuoso and allows you to explore the knowledge graph of vulnerabilities and packages.

---

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap / TODO

- Improve web application, to allow filtering and searching of vulnerabilities by adding more advanced SPARQL queries for deeper insights.
- Implement LLM's for advanced processing of data
- Make LinkPack available as a web service instead of a local application, allowing users to access it via a web interface without needing to run the backend locally.
